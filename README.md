## Description

Our goal was to create a scheduling website. On this website, the user is able to create a login and log daily, weekly and monthly tasks. Once a task is created it is added to the userâ€™s profile for reference and shown on the calendar. The user is also shown a to-do list of the tasks for the day.
As a user, I want to be able to quickly log and view all upcoming tasks I may have and be able to organize them by daily, weekly or monthly tasks.
